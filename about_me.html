        <p>Hi, my name is Eddie! I am a 28 year old transportation manager for my family's catering
             business in Arlington, Virginia. I've lived in the DC metro area for my entire life, save for college,
            when I lived in Southwest Virginia while studying Geography at Emory and Henry College. I used the skills 
            I learned at school to help modernize our business, shifting from using addresses written on paper to
            an electronic geodatabase containing all of our customers' locations. <br>
            As I have learned more about the 
            family business, I found more and more things that could (should) be modernized, updated, automated, etc. 
            I began teaching myself a little bit of Python and Javascript to try to create the tools we need to simplify our 
            operations, but I quickly realized that I was in a bit in over my head. As much as I enjoyed tinkering with code and
            creating small scripts to keep track of things like van maintenance, I felt that I was never going to able to 
            achieve the level of proficiency I needed to create full web applications. So, I decided to sign up for Coding Temple!
            My goal is to get the tools necessary to overhaul my family's business, and then use those projects to springboard
            myself into a new career in coding. </p>
